/*  
    Made by Jeremyah Flowers and Doriz Concepcion for Duke ECE350 - CLUE game outline
    
    If you have not yet, please read the README for the project before editing the C-Outline as this will make your life
    (and my life) easier. Namely, make sure you understand the section labeled "Notes to editors" where you will find
    notes about c, examples of good vs. bad c code, and notes about assembly. 

    Code Description: C-Outline for the CLUE game logic assembled in "GameLogic.s". This outline can be used to track
    changes to the overall code structure and later debug unexpected behavior found in the assembly. Includes added 
    comments for readability as well as TODOs for the developers. The functionality used in this code is based on the 
    architecture of the CURRENT working processor, meaning any additional functionality must be added and tested prior 
    to being implemented in the ISA.
 
    When developing the C-code outline for the assembly, remember that each line will be mapped to the cooresponding
    line in (pseudo-)MIPS. This means using complex functions and/or long lines of codes is ill-advised, as this will 
    make it harder to map and debug code in assembly. Instead, it is preferred to used simple, clean logic that can be
    easily followed in C, assmebly, and by other programmers (i.e., me). If you would like an example of this done 
    in easily readable code, please review the sub-section "Examples of Good vs. Bad C Code for Conversion" found under
    the README in "Notes for Editors."
